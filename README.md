# üèí Minor League Tracker

**Minor League Tracker** custom Home Assistant integration that monitors upcoming, live, and past games for any team supported by [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com). Built with a focus on minor league teams (like the Kansas City Mavericks üèí), it can be used for **any team-based sport** TheSportsDB supports.
This entire thing was built just so I could get ECHL minor league hockey data on the scrolling info display in my living room so let my hyperfixation help you as well!

## üõ† Configuration Options (Coming Soon)

In a future release, you‚Äôll be able to:
- Choose which attributes to track
- Enable/disable sensors per team
- Select from a dropdown list of available leagues and teams
- working on scores however the limited API does not include live scoring watch for a seperate integration with v2 API support

## üß† Notes

- Uses TheSportsDB **Free v1 API**
- Requires an active internet connection
- Ensure your team name is spelled exactly as it appears in TheSportsDB
 For reference if you wanted to see data for the KC Mavericks you would need to enter "kansas city mavericks" as the team name exactly.
